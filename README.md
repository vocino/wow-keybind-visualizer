# WoW Keybind Visualizer

A tool for visualizing and planning World of Warcraft keybindings across multiple characters using a unified, muscle-memory-focused system.

## The Problem

Playing multiple tank specs in WoW means managing 6 different sets of keybinds. Most players either:
- Use completely different keybinds for each character (hard to remember)
- Click abilities (slow and inefficient)
- Copy random keybind setups that don't make sense together

## The Solution

Create ONE keybind philosophy where the same key does the same **type** of thing across all characters:
- **Q** = "Primary Mitigation" → Shield Block (Warrior), Death Strike (DK), Purifying Brew (Monk)
- **E** = "Ground Effect" → Consecration (Paladin), Death and Decay (DK), etc.
- **R** = "Primary Builder" → Judgment (Paladin), Heart Strike (DK), Mangle (Druid)

## How It Works

1. **Define Functions**: Assign abstract concepts like "Primary Mitigation" or "Mobility" to keys
2. **Map to Specs**: The tool automatically shows which specific ability goes on that key for each tank spec
3. **Export**: Print or save your keybind reference for all 6 tanks

## Example

Instead of remembering:
- "Q is Shield Block on Warrior"
- "F is Death Strike on DK"  
- "3 is Purifying Brew on Monk"

You remember:
- **Q is always "save me now" mitigation** across ALL tanks

## Target Users

- Players who want to play multiple tank specs
- People who struggle with keybind management
- Anyone who values muscle memory and consistency
- Players using the WoW 1-button assist who need to bind critical abilities manually

## Features (Planned)

- Interactive keyboard layout
- Click keys to assign functions
- Switch between 6 tank specs to see specific abilities
- Export/print reference sheets
- Save and load configurations
- Shareable presets

## Tech Stack

TBD - Needs to be simple, fast, and visual-first
